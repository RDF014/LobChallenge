# LobChallenge

An application that sends a letter to the President of the United States.

For the client, I used the React framework and bootstrapped it with the 'Create React App' npm module.

The backend was built using Node with the Express framework.


Starting the application.

1) Within the root directory, run 'npm install'
  - This will install all the dependencies for the server

2) Move into the client folder and run 'npm install'
  - This will install all the dependencies for the client

3) Once all the dependencies are installed, move back into the root directory of the project and run 'npm run start'
  - This will run the app and the server

To access the app, in your web browser go to localhost:3000
